**The Abuse Project**<sup>[1](#References)</sup> was started with this silly project idea that I initially found on some reddit thread, in the process of building this, I observed that there was no such library or utility available, so, I created one and named it **Abuse**<sup>[2](#References)</sup>. At first, it seemed like a mistake, and people told me that this library will be used in malicious purposes which I didn't thought at the time of creation, long after creating the library, one day, while sitting with my friend Manav Kapil who is an excellent graphic designer, he was telling me about how time consuming it is to do repetitive tasks, like, muting abusive words from a survey video and that was the moment of _eureka_, can this be automated ? I spinned up my laptop, closed everything that was running and started searching if there's a plugin, SaaS service, website, software anything that solves this problem. Nothing was found. I then turned to research side, started searching over **Google Scholar**<sup>[3](#References)</sup> and was surprised, nothing similar was found, and that was the moment **The Abuse Project**<sup>[1](#References)</sup> was born.
